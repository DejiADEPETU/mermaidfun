## Synopsis
Title: Mermaid Fun Racing Game. [MFRG for short] - OR - [ MerFuRaG for short]
This is a javascript game that runs in the DOM.
It was inspired by suggestions from my daughters, Izzy & Tori.
This game is thus based on the specifications of my first "real life" clients!

1. Your[PLAYER1] objectives are to collect as many treasures as you can while racing against a friend [PLAYER2] or Herxaula[theAi].
2. You can choose to race against the time [theCLOCK] or compete based on points [capturedTREASURE]
3. You will face creatures[OBSTACLES], helpers[PowerUPs;blasterTRIDENTS,immunityCLOCKS], grid-paths[mazeTRACKS] as well as random-weather-patterns[oceanCURRENTS;earthTREMORS;heatWAVES,lavaSPILLS]
4. When you win, you get archived into the scoreRecords[recordKEEPER]
5. If you lose, you are given the option to try against[RepeatGAME]
